#### **The past**
I've held the DBA title for many years. Starting in the Albany, NY area I started in the Help Desk at a casino and worked my way up to Database Developer and then onto Database Administrator at a manufacturing company and an insurance company. In the summer of 2015 my family and I moved out to the Boston, MA area where I stayed for the past 4.5 years.

#### **The present**
I spent those 4.5 years at the Boston Beer Company first as a DBA and was recently promoted to a Sr. DBA position. I have learned a lot while there including working with the Azure cloud, better automation, Data Warehousing, and working through several version upgrades.

A few weeks ago I resigned from that position. It was by far the hardest departure I have ever had. There were several reasons I left, but I would prefer not to air my dirty laundry here. Come find me at my next talk at a SQL Saturday, User group meeting, or Code Camp if you really must know.

#### **The future**
I have started a new position at New Balance. It is a parallel move for me professionally, but it will allow me to grow professionally even further than if I stayed. This position will allow me to learn and grow from others and even more about infrastructure than I could have.

I am also excited about the opportunity to work for a company that is fitness/health and wellness focused. I think it will be the best thing for my health so that I can be there for my family as time goes on.


Until next time - Matt
