          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to reason about the minds of other agents. The main theme of our workshop is the computational modeling of ToM, with a special focus on the role of natural language in such modeling. Specifically, ToM 2023 pays attention to cognitive foundations and theories of ToM, the acquisition and relationship between language and ToM, leveraging ToM to improve and explain NLP and ML models, and using ToM for positive social impact. This workshop intends to promote the community of researchers that are interested in improving the ability of intelligent agents to reason about others' mental states. Our proposed program provides a space to discuss pathways for understanding and applying ToM in psycholinguistics, pragmatics, human value alignment, social good, model explainability, and many other areas of NLP. ToM 2023 will be a full-day hybrid in-person/virtual workshop with several keynote speeches, and oral/poster/spotlight presentations, followed by a breakout discussion, panel discussion, and best paper award announcement. We also intend to host a mentoring program to broaden participation from a diverse set of researchers.
